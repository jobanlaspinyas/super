            <h2>HOW SYSTEMS HOLD MANAGERS ACCOUNTABLE</h2>
            <p>A work description that is specific about the task at hand, how it should be carried out, and to your standards of quality. A training approach that guarantees they learn it throughout training in such a way that they can perform it after training is over without supervision or assistance. A budget for the restaurant that outlines the methods that must be implemented to reach the set goals and offers management a target to aim towards.</p>
            <br>
            <p>A weekly or monthly budget variance report that compares actual results with the budget will give management a clear financial report card that will help them determine which systems need to be examined and which new ones should be implemented. In-depth check lists for each position! These form the basis for outlining requirements in detail for EVERY job within the restaurant. This makes it possible for management and employees to carry out expectations in a conflict-free manner. due to the fact that common sense is a myth. They must be specifically instructed on what must be done and how to do it. </p>
            <br>
            <p>Changing the way YOU, the owner or general manager, see accountability Instead of seeing accountability as a burden, consider it an opportunity to coach, to join your management team in its success, to become a trainer, and not simply a parent who scolds their kids to instill lessons. Understanding that your own state is now just like the State of Missouri - "The Show Me State!" rather than simply accepting a manager's word that they completed a task or did what you asked them to do. Saying "excellent, show me" instead of accepting the response "yeah, it was done" puts you in a position to verify that it was done, and if it wasn't, or wasn't done to your standards, it offers you the chance to coach for success.</p>
